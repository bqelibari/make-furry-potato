#not expanded during read in phase,
#expansion occurs during first usage instead.
foo = $(bar)
bar = $(baz)
baz = Hello
#disadvantages may be infinite recursive expansion loops
#functions will be executed every time the variable is used.

#:= and ::=(POSIX) define simply expanded variables.
#those vars are expanded immediately

foo := hello
bar := $(foo) there
foo := bye
#makes compilcated makefiles more predictable
#much like variables in programming languages
